Insights: 

1. On-Time Delivery Performance by City 
 * Pune and Mumbai tied for the highest average on
time delivery percentage, each recording a perfect score of 1.00.   
 * Delhi followed closely with an on-time delivery rate of 0.95. 
 * Chennai recorded the lowest performance, with an average on
time delivery of 0.50, indicating potential route inefficiencies or de lays. 
Action: Prioritize investigation into Chennai’s delivery operations to identify an
  d resolve bottlenecks. 
2. Fuel Efficiency Overview 
• January: Fuel efficiency was 11.51 km/l, outperforming February. 
• February: Slightly lower at 11.39 km/l. 
Action: Analyze February’s routes and vehicle usage to understand the drop an
 d replicate January's efficiency patterns. 
3. Cost per KM Trends & Anomalies 
Steepest Decline (Cost Optimization) 
• From ₹67.38 to ₹30.20 between Monday, January 16 and Saturday, January 21, 2023. 
• This is a 55.18% decrease over 5 days. 
• Indicates effective cost optimization during this period. 
Cost Anomalies 
• Sunday, January 1, 2023: Spiked to ₹103.25 
• Thursday, January 26, 2023: Extreme anomaly at ₹1,194.29 
Action: Review and validate cost inputs for these dates; check for data entry errors, unplanned events, or exceptional operational costs. 

Overall Dashboard Deliverables 
• Interactive Route Map: Visualize route-wise delivery performance (Origin → Destination). 
• Fleet Usage Panel: Track vehicle utilization and idle time. 
• KPI Cards: On-Time %, Avg Delay, Fuel Efficiency, Cost per KM.
